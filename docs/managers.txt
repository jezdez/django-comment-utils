============================================
Custom manager for models which use comments
============================================


It's relatively common, when a model will be making use of the comment
system, to want to perform a query for the "most commented" or "most
discussed" objects of that model -- those objects which have received
the most comments. To make this easier, ``comment_utils`` provides a
custom manager which includes a generic method for performing this
query.


``comment_utils.managers.CommentedObjectManager``
-------------------------------------------------

This is a simple custom manager which can query for the "most
commented" objects of the model it's attached to. This is accomplished
through a single method named ``most_commented``, which takes the
following keyword arguments::

    num
        The maximum number of objects to return. Defaults to 5 if not
        supplied.

    free
        If ``True``, will query for objects with the most
        ``FreeComment`` objects (unregistered comments) attached to
        them; if ``False``, will query for objects with the most
        ``Comment`` objects (registered comments) attached to
        them. Defaults to ``True`` if not supplied.

Because the order of the objects -- objects with higher comment counts
should come first -- is important, this method returns a list rather
than a ``QuerySet``. Each item in the returned list will be a
dictionary with the following keys::

    object
        An object of the model the ``CommentedObjectManager`` is
        attached to.

    comment_count
        The number of comments on that object.

There are two primary ways to make use of this manager:

1. When you have a model which will be making use of comments, but
   would not otherwise have a custom manager.

2. When you have a model which will be making use of comments, but
   will need a custom manager to add functionality specific to that
   model.

To show how to use ``CommentedObjectManager`` in either case, we'll
use the following example model, which might represent entries in a
weblog.

    from django.db import models
    
    STATUS_CHOICES = (
        (1, 'Live'),
        (2, 'Hidden'),
    )
    
    class Entry(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(maxlength=250)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField()
        body = models.TextField()
        status = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS_CHOICES)

If the ``Entry`` model wants to use comments, but you wouldn't
otherwise want a custom manager on it, adding
``CommentedObjectManager`` is just a two-line change; add the
following at the top of the models file::

    from comment_utils.managers import CommentedObjectManager

And then inside the ``Entry`` class add this line::

    objects = CommentedObjectManager()

This will override the automatic manager assigned by Django, so that
``Entry.objects`` will be an instance of ``CommentedObjectManager``;
all the usual manager methods (``all``, ``filter``, etc.) will still
work, but ``Entry.objects.most_commented()`` will also be available.

If the ``Entry`` model should also have its own custom manager -- say,
to enable automatic filtering out of "hidden" entries in order to
avoid displaying them -- then that manager should subclass
``CommentedObjectManager`` instead of Django's base ``Manager``
class. The implementation might look like this::

    from comment_utils.managers import CommentedObjectManager
    
    class LiveEntryManager(CommentedObjectManager):
        def get_query_set(self):
            return super(LiveEntryManager,  self).get_query_set().filter(status__exact=1)

Then, ``LiveEntryManager`` could be attached to ``Entry`` in the same
fashion as any other custom manager, and it would provide the
``most_commented`` method in addition to performing the custom
filtering (note that ``most_commented``, in this case, would only look
at entries with "live" status, due to the overriding of
``get_query_set`` in ``LiveEntryManager``).
